Custom Backend configuration for rainbowkit-siwe, with NextJS 14. It should work with any other framework.

NextJS-rainbowkit-siwe app repository: [https://github.com/SanguineTitan57/backend2.git]

Use npm run dev (running the server using nodemon is originally [nodemonindex.js] (put a space between nodemon and index.js))to start the server (you can change the command to your liking). Check [package.json] for the custom command.
